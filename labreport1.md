# Installing Visual Studio Code
- first go to this website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- from there, follow the instructions to download and install the program on your computer
- if all the steps were followed correctly, Visual Studio Code should be working and ready to use
# Remotely Connecting
- First, we installed git bash using this link: https://gitforwindows.org/
- then we opened a git bash terminal in VScode(VSC) and entered the following command: $ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu but the zz is replaced by your specific account number
- we were then prompted for a password and upon correct entry, we were successfully connected to a computer in the CSE basement
# Trying Some Commands
- Once the connection was established, we used commands such as cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp
- cd went to the specified directory
- ls printed out the contents of the specified directory
- pwd printed the current working directory
- mkdir made a new directory
- I forgot to test the cp, command, however I created a text file with this command: "cat > hello.txt" that said "hello world"
- I then used ls to test if it worked and it successfully printed the statement.
